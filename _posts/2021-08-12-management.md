- Different from other managements
- Apply both engineering principles & skill in organising/directing people/porjects
- Especially need for dealing with **great uncertainties** associated with high-technology env.
- Affects recognizing opportunities, evaluating technical capabilities, maximising the benefits of R&D, and solving customers' problems.
## Roles & funcs of Engineering management
managements is normally classified into three levels:
1. Top management
2. Middle management
3. First-line management
